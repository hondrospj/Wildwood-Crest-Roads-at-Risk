# Wildwood Crest Roads at Risk

Static GitHub Pages app for drawing road and cross-section profiles through the Wildwood Crest municipal DEM.

The interface follows the North Wildwood Roads at Risk reference: threshold presets, NAVD88/MLLW conversion, terrain and hillshade views, saved multi-line cross sections, flood-history and future-frequency charts, and CSV/Shapefile exports.

Municipal constants:

- Observations: USGS 01411390, Cape May Harbor
- PETSS / NOAA station: 8535901
- NAVD88 thresholds: 3.43 ft minor, 4.43 ft moderate, 5.43 ft major
- MLLW thresholds: 6.2 ft minor, 7.2 ft moderate, 8.2 ft major
- MLLW = NAVD88 + 2.77 ft

Terrain source: USGS 3DEP Bare Earth DEM Dynamic ImageServer, clipped to the Wildwood Crest Borough boundary at 5-foot resolution.

## Drawing and map controls

Draw, Clear, and Finish Line are in the top Map box. Aerial and Streets are the available basemaps; Aerial is the default. Low, Intermediate, and High scenario controls are below Observed History. Map zoom reaches 21; overzoom does not improve the source imagery or elevation resolution.

Snap to roads uses NJOGIS NG911 centerlines from `wildwood_crest_road_centerlines.geojson`. The roads are clipped to this application's existing municipal boundary for display, snapping, and routing. A missing boundary or road dataset disables road snapping; users can explicitly choose freehand mode. These profiles are not safe-driving directions or surveyed bridge-deck elevations.

The snapping checkbox stays available while drawing. Turning it off retains the draft control points and joins them directly. Turning it on snaps a connectable draft to roads; an incompatible draft stays freehand with an explanation. Completed profiles and the existing browser storage key are preserved. Saved and exported road profiles retain their traced geometry.

Queries use the existing municipal boundary envelope in WGS84, preserve OBJECTID and source elevation-level fields, paginate in OBJECTID order, and validate the returned feature count. Runtime clipping prevents routes from leaving and re-entering the municipality.
